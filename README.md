# MUSHRA-MaxMSP

A Max/MSP patcher for MUSHRA listening tests.

This patcher is designed for conducting MUSHRA (MUltiple Stimulus with Hidden Reference and Anchor, see ITU-R BS.1534) listening tests. The patcher allows the comparison of a number of stimuli (7 by default, although up to 10 is supported) and facilitates repeats. By default, the patcher can compare seven processes applied to three music tracks, with two repeats, making a total of six pages. However, the patcher can be easily adapted to accommodate a different number of stimuli and/or music tracks and/or repeats; the included documentation describes the procedure in detail.
